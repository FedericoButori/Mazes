Hello!

I just started learning Python, so I'm making this repository for keeping track of the 
progress I make and with the hope that one day it can be of any help to whoever will be 
starting as well.

I have covered the basics of the syntax and objects like list, tuples, dictionaries ecc...
and I've decided to jump straight into some projects to learn this language "the hard way".
This is because I somehow already have a little of experience in programming (I was taught
how to use matlab and basics of C at university), so I already have the basics concepts of 
programming. Also, I come from a math background so I'm quite fluent with analysis and linear 
algebra, which might make it easier for me to understand how some algorithm work or are 
implemented. 

The fields I'm most interested in (and for which I'm learning python) are machine learning
and artificial intelligence (which for know I know very little of), so for the most part the
projects i'll be working on will be heading in that direction (but not necessarily!). 

This repository is organized in folders, each containing all the files used for a certain 
project, code is quite commented because most of the time I'm learning stuff while writing it,
so the comments works kind of as notes. I might also add some notes about specific things I 
learned for a given project but I'm not promising anything. I'll try to add a text file in each 
folder explaining why I decided to start working on some project, the progress at which it is 
and some major topics that I covered in that project.

Lastly, since, as I said, I'm learning, any comment or correction will be very happily accepted,
so feel free to comment!

Happy reading, and if you too are starting, good luck!
