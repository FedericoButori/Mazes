# Mazes
So, the first project I decided to work on is a maze solver. 

I got this idea watching a video on YouTube from Computerphile and decided it was a nice 
project to start implementing some stuff in Python.

The first intuition I got from the video was to use graphs to model the problem.
Also, I found out that there is way of implementing graphs using dictionaries (another 
possibility I thought of later on was to use matrix) so I decided to take up this problem
as a way to revise and learn more about dictionaries and how they work.
